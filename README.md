P-Hacking Research Project
This repository contains the data, analysis, and findings from a collaborative research project on p-hacking in academic research, conducted by Hanna Rey, Ben Williams, Rayan Elmore, and Kristian [Your Last Name]. P-hacking refers to the manipulation of data analysis to produce statistically significant results, often leading to misleading or false conclusions in scientific studies. This project aims to explore the prevalence of p-hacking in top business research journals and highlight its impact on research integrity.

Project Overview
Objective: To investigate the occurrence of p-hacking in articles published in the FT 50 list of prestigious business journals.
Methodology: Automated extraction of p-values from research papers published in 2023, followed by a statistical analysis to identify potential instances of p-hacking.
Key Findings: Detailed analysis and visualizations of p-value distributions across different research disciplines, highlighting patterns and anomalies indicative of p-hacking.
Contents
data/: Raw and processed datasets used for the analysis.
scripts/: Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for data extraction, cleaning, and analysis.
figures/: Graphs and visualizations generated from the analysis.
