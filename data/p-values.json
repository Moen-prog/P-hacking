Work Moralization \u00d7 Value Congruence (interaction on Moral Rumination):  (p < .001)\n4. Work Moralization (on Cognitive Flexibility): \u0086 (which suggests borderline significance, typically p < .10)\n5. Value Congruence (on Cognitive Flexibility):  (p < .01)\n6. Work Moralization \u00d7 Value Congruence (interaction on Cognitive Flexibility):  (p < .05)\n7. Moral Rumination affecting Creativity:  (p < .05)\n8. Cognitive Flexibility affecting Creativity:  (p < .05)\n\nMedian Significance Levels for Multi-Level Variables as found in Table 4:\n- Moral Rumination Indicators:  (p < .01) \n- Cognitive Flexibility Indicators: \u0086 (close to p < .10)\n\nFrom the description and analysis of variables with varying significance, the median significance level for variables with multiple levels of significance is typically . This median is calculated by considering the most common significance level observed within each subgroup of related variables (groups affecting Moral Rumination, Cognitive Flexibility, and Creativity outcomes).\n", "sig2": NaN, "sig3": NaN, "sig4": NaN, "sig 5": NaN, "sig 6": NaN, "sig 7": NaN, "sig8": NaN, "Unnamed: 21": NaN, "Unnamed: 22": NaN, "Unnamed: 23": NaN, "Unnamed: 24": NaN, "Unnamed: 25": NaN, "comment": NaN, "Unnamed: 27": NaN}, {"Article / Title": "How Do Field Workers in Poverty Craft Meaningful Roles to Achieve Social Impact?

The document is a conceptual and meta-analytic study comparing turnover intentions across professions and discusses broader conceptual findings from a pooled meta-analysis. It employs meta-analytic techniques to synthesize existing research findings rather than performing primary regression analysis on new data. Therefore, specific significance levels typically indicated by asterisks in regression tables are not applicable here, as the study uses integrated literature findings rather than primary empirical data with statistical tests typically seen in regression tables.", "sig2": NaN, "sig3": NaN, "sig4": NaN, "sig 5": NaN, "sig 6": NaN, "sig 7": NaN, "sig8": NaN, "Unnamed: 21": NaN, "Unnamed: 22": NaN, "Unnamed: 23": NaN, "Unnamed: 24": NaN, "Unnamed: 25": NaN, "comment": NaN, "Unnamed: 27": NaN}], "Constantine Yannelis": [{"Article / Title": "Tuition, Debt, and Human Capital", "Journal": "The Review of Financial Studies", "Category": "Finance", "Year": 2023.0, "Athors ": "Rajashri Chakrabarti, Vyacheslav Fos, Andres Liberman, Constantine Yannelis", "Affiliation 1": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York", "Affiliation 2": "Carroll School of Management, Boston College", "Affiliation 3": "Betterfly, Santiago (Chile)", "Affiliation 4": "Booth School of Business, the University of Chicago", "Affiliation 5": NaN, "Affilitation 6": NaN, "Affilitation 7": NaN, "Type of research / methods": NaN, "sig1": "0.01", "sig2": "0.05", "sig3": "0", "sig4": "0", "sig 5": "0.01", "sig 6": "0.05", "sig 7": "0", "sig8": "0", "Unnamed: 21": NaN, "Unnamed: 22": NaN, "Unnamed: 23": NaN, "Unnamed: 24": NaN, "Unnamed: 25": NaN, "comment": "levels = 0.1, 0.05, 0.01", "Unnamed: 27": NaN}], "Cornelia Pechmann": [{"Article / Title": "The performance effects of creative imitation on original products: Evidence from lab and field experiments", "Journal": "Strategic Management Journal ", "Category": "managment", "Year": NaN, "Athors ": "Liangyan Wang, Brian Wu, Cornelia Pechmann, Yitong Wang", "Affiliation 1": "Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China; Strategy Department, Stephen M.
